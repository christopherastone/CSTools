Tools for working with student-submitted code in CS courses. So far, there's:

* StyleCheck: Checks C++ code for conformance with several of the style guidelines for HMC's CS 70.

* Replacer: Replaces one or more functions in a specified file with code extracted from another file. Useful for replacing broken functions with the corresponding versions from a solution. (Eventually the plan is to automatically diagnose errors by automatically determining the fewest number of functions one can replace with correct code, in order to pass the automated tests.)
